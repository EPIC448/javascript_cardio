/* Key Points in the assignment / Basic Credit Card Processing

 Features: Add New Credit Card accounts
           Process charges
           Credits against CHARGES
           Display or Print out the Summary information 

  Requirements - 1: 
        No artifacts or Binary Dependencies
        Most include AUTOMATED TESTS in the submission
    You may implement your own Luhn 10 check, or you may use an external library.
      We do not prefer either approach over the other, but your solution will be
      assessed on correctness and testing.
    In addition to your source code and tests (remember, no binaries), please also
    README that explains:
      An overview of your design decisions
      Why you picked the programming language you used
      How to install any required dependencies (runtimes, frameworks, etc)
      How to build, package or compile your code if applicable
      How to run your code and tests

    
 Requirement -2:
        Program accepts 2 input from two sources:
      âˆš A filename Passed as a commond line argument,  ./myprograminput.txt;
         input read from STDIN,   .myprogram < input.txt.

        Program most read the whole input 

        Program most accept 3 input command with space delimited arguments:
        "Add" -> Create a new credit card for a given Name, CardNumber, Limit
                Card Number Validated using Luhn 10
                New cards starts with a $0 balance. 

        "Charge" -> Charges increase the balance of card assoicated with Provided name by the amount specified.
                    Charges that raise the balance over the Limit are ignored as if declined
                    Charges against Luhn invalid cards are ignored also.

        "Credit" -> decrease the balance of the card assoicated with the provided name by the amount specified.
                    Credits that would dropt balance below $0 will create negative balance
                    Credits against Luhn 10 Invalid cards are ignored.
        
         When Input has been Read, and Processed, a summary should be generated and written to STDOUT in the formate shown below. 
         Summary includes:

         name of each person followed by a colon and balance.
         name displayed alphabetically -  .sort() method
         Display "error" instead of the balance if the credit card number does not pass Luhn 10

------  Input and Output:-------
Given the following input:

Add Tom 4111111111111111 $1000
Add Lisa 5454545454545454 $3000
Add Quincy 1234567890123456 $2000
Charge Tom $500
Charge Tom $800
Charge Lisa $7
Credit Lisa $100
Credit Quincy $200

Your program must produce the following output:

Lisa: $-93
Quincy: error
Tom: $500

----------------Input Assumptions:----------
All input will be valid. For example, 
you DON'T need to CHECK for or gracefully handle:
Illegal characters
Malformed commands
Capitalization changes
Multiple "Add" commands for the same name
Different names with the same credit card number
"Charge" or "Credit" commands without a preceding "Add" command

All input will be space delimited.
Credit card numbers may vary in length up to 19 characters.
Credit card numbers will always be numeric.
Amounts will always be prefixed with "$" and will be in whole dollars (no
decimals).






-----------                    My Question. 
                    what is a STDOUT. javascript
