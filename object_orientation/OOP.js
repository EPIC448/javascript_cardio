      Programming vocabulary:

In JavaScript objects are a type of variable. This may cause confusion, because objects can 
also be declared without a class template in JavaScript, as shown at the beginning.

Objects have states and behaviors. State is defined by data: things like names, birthday, 
and other information youâ€™d want to store about a dog. Behaviors are methods, the object can undertake.
